        <h1>Why Build Projects ?</h1>

        <p><strong class="qns">What is <snap style="color: #0caa0c">Project</snap> ?</strong>
        <br>
        <snap class="ans">When we develop a solution of a particuler problem based the programming knowledge we gain or other skills we achieve, then that solution is defined as a <strong style="color: #0caa0c">Project</strong>.</snap>
        <br><br>
        <strong class="qns">Why we need to build <snap style="color: #0caa0c">Projects ?</snap></strong>
        <br>
        <snap class="ans">When we learn a <strong>programming language</strong>, we learn it step by step. So, when developing knowledge step by step we get to know the contexts and we solve problems topic by topic. Lets take an example for <strong>Java</strong>. When you are learning <strong>Encapsulation</strong>, <strong>Inheritance</strong>, <strong>Polymorphism</strong>, <strong>Abstruction</strong>, <strong>Aggregation</strong>, <strong>etc.</strong> we do good. But when we need to build a <strong>project</strong>, we can not apply these techniques one by one. We have combine them, we have to allocate them in one place to make a <strong>successful project</strong>. <br>
        So, to have a better knowledge over the programming language you are learning, you must build projects which will not only make your knowledge strong but also make your CV heavy and experience grown.</snap><br><br>
        <strong class="qns">How to build a <snap style="color: #0caa0c">Project ?</snap> What are the steps ? </strong>
        <br><br>
        <snap class="point">&#9654;</snap> &nbsp;&nbsp;Read the requirements carefully. Keep notes if need to.<br>
        <snap class="point">&#9654;</snap> &nbsp;&nbsp;Break the <strong>project</strong> requirments into multiple sections and each section must be catagorized by topics, purpose, or method, etc.<br>
        <snap class="point">&#9654;</snap> &nbsp;&nbsp;Create a tree or graphic visual that represnt the functionalities of the project that means creatng a visualization that how the project will look like.<br>
        <snap class="point">&#9654;</snap> &nbsp;&nbsp;Start developing the project by the respective language means the language was assigned by the course instructor or you manager or the language you want to choose. Start from the parts that you understand and check the code continuously after a certain time period so that you can avoid large and time consuming exceptions or errors. <br>
        <snap class="point">&#9654;</snap> &nbsp;&nbsp;When you get stuck, do not go to the internet for instance. First look at the visualization ( UML ), think, take time. If you have enough idea about the basics of the programming language that at least you will be able to delect the problem. Keep trying but when you really need help google it, borrow the concept and biuld by yourself.<br><br> &#9940;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong style="color: red">Do not copy codes from the internet. It will ruin your carrier. </strong><br>
        &#9989;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong style="color: rgb(6, 185, 6)">Borrow the concept and try to do by yourself. If fail, go and learn it but <snap style="color: red">do not copy.</snap> </strong>
