            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>Students often get confused about choosing the topic they should focus. I am here to help to reduce the confusion. Explore and learn. if you manage to learn something, it will be my pleasure. <br><br>
            The ability to teach someone is blessing and I find it fasinating. I always try to teach someone the topic I learn today. From that desire I created this portal. I start teaching by teaching my one of the best friends and the topic was <strong>Git & Github</strong>. Then I finished my C Programming Language course and started teaching C Programming Language. Then I got shift from Basabo to Kolabagan as my campus was at Dhanmondi. There I started teaching by creating a <strong>Facebook Page</strong> and the the name was <strong><snap style="color: #004607">SRS IT</snap><snap style="color: #00B007"> Solution</snap></strong>. However that page was deleted and I changed my teaching style. Now I'm here in Youtube to make a portal where you guys can manage to learn something.</p>

            <h3>Topic that I still Regret: </h3>

            <p>From childhood, I wanted to be a veterinary doctor. The terms of the animals always attracted me so much. But that was my desire and the reality was to different. My gurdians wanted me to be a MBBS Doctor. So they set all the requirements. I had no desire to be a MBBS Doctor. There was another profession that I hated so much and that was <strong>Engineering</strong>. <br>
            So, accidentally I slipped from the admission test of MBBS. As I have taken MBBS preparetion, I left mathematics behind everything. Now, other admission exmas requir mathematics and my parents discouraged me for public University. So, they decided to admit me at private university in <strong>CSE</strong>. <br> 
            I got admitted in <a href="https://daffodilvarsity.edu.bd/">Daffodil International University</a> in <strong>Computer Science and Engineering</strong> Department. <br>
            
            It felt to so broken when the admission of agricultural universities arrived and I didn't even attend. I was selected for the admission but I didn't attend because I knew that after 2 semesters in DIU, I cann't get through the admission exam and the failure will hunt me more. <br>
            
            But now, I have motivated myself for CSE and I am glad to have people to think about me. They thought and here I am. Now, at the time of writing this, I am at 5th semester and doing quite well, <strong>Alhamdolillah</strong>. 

            <br><br>

            <strong>However, now I don't have any regret but whenever I hear something about animal science or study I feel blur, That's all. </strong>
